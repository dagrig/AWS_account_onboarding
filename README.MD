# AWS Account Onboarding with Terraform

This project automates the creation of AWS organizations, organizational units, Route 53 resources, and new AWS accounts using Terraform.

There are two deployment Options I have decided to include:

**Option 1**: Vanilla Terraform.
**Option 2**: Using Terragrunt wrapper.

You can find detailed README files to run each solution in respective folders.
